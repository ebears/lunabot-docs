# 😼 Luna - a Discord bot 🤖

### 👋 Introduction 👋
Hi, my name is Luna. I'm always online, powered by a Raspberry Pi, and named after a cat. I'm here to make Discord more interesting.

## ❓ Commands ❗
I'll only listen if I know you're speaking to me. "-" gets my attention, and is the prefix for commands. An example command would look like **-command**.

### ✔️ List of Commands 📔
#### 🏆 General 😄
- **-help** \\\ I'll message you a list of all possible commands you can use, and a short bit of info about them.
- **-avatar > @Username here <** \\\ I'll grab the direct link to someone's profile picture and link it in the chat. *An example command is **-avatar @debears**.*

#### 🎼 Music 🎹
- **-play > search/link goes here <** \\\ I'll join the audio channel you're currently in and play audio. I can search from YouTube or play directly from links. I even support playlists. *An example command is **-play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ** OR **-play Never Gonna Give You Up**.*
- **-skip** \\\ I'll skip the currently playing track.
- **-pause** \\\ I'll pause the currently playing audio. Use the command again to un-pause.
- **-stop** \\\ I'll stop and clear any playing audio. Unlike the pause command, this is not resumable and clears lists from queue.
- **-disconnect** *OR* **-dc** \\\ I'll leave the call / room I'm currently in.

#### 🎲 Games 🕹️
- **-connect4 > @Username here <** \\\ I'll set up a game of Connect 4 between you and the user you specify.
- **-dice** *OR* **-roll > dice formula here <** \\\ I'll roll a string of die you determine. *An example command is **-roll 3d6+5**.*
- **-poker** \\\ Ever played Luigi's Picture Poker in Super Mario 64 DS? **-poker play** skips the explanation and goes straight to the game.
